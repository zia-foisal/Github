## Chapter 2:  Entering and cleaning data

Most ﬂat ﬁles come in two general categories:
  1. Fixed width ﬁles : are ﬁles where a column always has the same width, for all the rows in the column.
  2. Delimited ﬁles:
    • “.csv”: Comma-separated values
    • “.tab,” “.tsv”: Tab-separated values
    • Other possible delimiters: colon, semicolon, pipe (“|”)
